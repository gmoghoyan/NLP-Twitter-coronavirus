A sentiment analysis of tweets regarding COVID-19

Since the outbreak of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in December 2019 and the ensuing pandemic, global opinion has varied about the situation. Many factors have come into play over the last few years: forced or voluntary confinement, mask policies, mandatory or voluntary vaccines, among others. These polarizing factors have led people to express their agreement - and obvious disagreement - on social media, notably Twitter. 

This project analyzed the overall sentiment of tweets associated with the disease in the year 2020.
